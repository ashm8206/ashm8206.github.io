The weight of my decision dawns upon me. I am flying away from the nest.
I had it coming from a while now, but it is only today that I really start taking responsibility for my impending move.<br>
I can barely count on my fingers the many nights spent staying up,wrecking my mind over this inevitable reality.There was something different about today,this wasn't one of those days.

I felt the weight of responsibility gently brush my arm,caress my cheek.
In that sombre silence, I wasn't answerable to anybody. If  I was made to answer, the choice between defiance and acceptance would solely be mine.I wasn't answerable to the society I had grown to hate. I was moving away to better pastures(better in my mind atleast),because they came with a much needed dose of liberalism. A novelty, compared to the harsh reality and the silent biases I was accustomed to suffering.

*The gentle touch made me wonder...*
 

When does one truly become free and by extension privy to greater responsibility?
Does the fragile construct of *voting eligibility* make one the guardian of their [natural freedom?](http://americainclass.org/sources/makingrevolution/rebellion/text8/decindep.pdf) Or is it the time when you first bleed?  Is freedom gender nuetral?  Is freedom/responsibility the feel of your [1st Salary?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_wages_by_country) Or is it the pleasure of spending on your [parents](https://www.babble.com/baby/child-rearing-around-world/) for a change?  Is freedom found in materialistic deliberations? Or is it something more deeper, an undecurrent that runs through the very fabric of your being? Such was the surge brought on by that gentle brush.

*As is clear to the reader,to me freedom and responsibility are entwined in intimate ways. They go beyond the material realm.*

To be free, is to be able to choose without heeding/caring for the chatter of a rigid environment.To be truly free,would be to live your truth, that's all yours, that hasn't been adulterated by the fear or guilt infused by your loved ones, or by the mundane trappings of one's own mind.
To be free and responsible as a happy extension then, is to find your place in the world, find your people and to find your soul.

I love all the people who have coloured my life *silly*. I don't feel any remorse in bidding them goodbye, I love them. I cherish them, but I do not agree with everything they have to say.

To be free then means to accept points of views starkly different from your own and to deny ourselves the gratification of proving them wrong.

To be free is to **Accept**<br>
To be free is to **Love unconditionally**<br>
