        		  <p>I am a 22 year old python enthusiast,writer, artist and  a general busy bee.I love following politics from all around the world, and I get all my news from the quintessential British host John Oliver and his pretentious cousin,Stephen Colbert. I find that they are always miles ahead of The Economist, 
        		  which makes them so much more entertaining than mainstream media.In my free time I am seen lurking in coffee shops reading almost anything from GRRM to Malcolm Gladwell. At other times, I am seen attending  Foreign Film Festivals and other cultural galas.I love writing, some of  my favourite bloggers are Mark Mason and Oliver Emberton.In my opinion StumbleUpon  is the best  discovery engine of all time albeit rather clunkier than Pinterest.I like learning something new everyday and it was because of this idea and a happy chance that I ended up studying Spanish for a month in Sevilla,Spain.I live by the saying “Don’t count the days,make the days count.”You can also check out my Github <a href ="https://github.com/ashm8206">Here.</a></p>
