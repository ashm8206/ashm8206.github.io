I am a 23 year old python enthusiast,writer, artist and a general busy bee.My interests include politics and philosophy.
I  believe in keeping a healthy liberal/conservative media diet and I get most(if not all) my news from the quirky odd-ball John Oliver.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Seneca's stoic wisdom inspires me;"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.", and it's the one principal I live by. I am a "Do-er" and have eclectic interests that range from outdoor sports to consuming non-fiction classics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Statistics and probability get me heady and I am always on the look-out for more non-conventional,practical resources on the subjects;theoretical stats in the absence of their real-world applications though essential are rather dry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
I am known linguaphile,a language nerd. I believe a language gives insights and breathes life into the culture that evolves around it. They help us get a deeper understanding of people from backgrounds disparate from our own.I personally speak four languages, spanish being the latest addition to that roster.</p>
